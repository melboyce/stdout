# ALMM - Unix primer
**WIP**

`What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do
programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew
from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by
remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a
terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.` -- Dennis Ritchie
